    faqQ1: "Co się stanie, jeśli mój przedmiot jest wadliwy? Czy jest jakaś gwarancja?",
    faqA1: "Tak! Większość zamówień objęta jest roczną gwarancją. Podaj numer faktury/zamówienia, abyśmy mogli to zbadać. Uwaga: Wymiana nie jest dozwolona, jeśli przedmiot jest zgodny z opisem, nawet jeśli zamówiłeś nieprawidłowo.",
    faqQ2: "Czy mogę edytować, aktualizować lub anulować zamówienie?",
    faqA2: "Tak. Ze względów bezpieczeństwa zmiany zamówienia mogą wymagać obsługi za pośrednictwem poczty e-mail lub naszego formularza kontaktowego.",
    faqQ3: "Czy muszę płacić cła/podatki importowe?",
    faqA3: "Cła i podatki zazwyczaj nie są opłacane z góry, z wyjątkiem DDP do USA. Podatek VAT może obowiązywać w UE, Wielkiej Brytanii, Australii/Nowej Zelandii, Norwegii, Szwajcarii i prowincjach kanadyjskich, takich jak Saskatchewan i Manitoba, który jest już domyślnie opłacony. W Singapurze nie obowiązuje podatek GST. Nie możemy doradzać w sprawach opłat celnych — skontaktuj się z lokalnym urzędem celnym, aby uzyskać szczegółowe informacje.",
    faqQ4: "Kiedy moje zamówienie zostanie wysłane?",
    faqA4: "Zamówienia są zazwyczaj wysyłane w ciągu 1-5 dni roboczych. W okresach dużego natężenia może to potrwać 5–7 dni.",

    faqA1: "Oes! Mae'r rhan fwyaf o archebion yn dod gyda gwarant 1 flwyddyn. Darparwch eich anfoneb/rhif archeb fel y gallwn ymchwilio. Nodyn: Ni chaniateir cyfnewidiadau os yw'r eitem yn cyfateb i'r disgrifiad, hyd yn oed os gwnaethoch archebu'n anghywir.",
    faqQ2: "A allaf olygu, diweddaru neu ganslo fy archeb?",
    faqA2: "Gallwch. Am resymau diogelwch, efallai y bydd angen trin newidiadau archeb trwy e-bost neu ar ein Ffurflen Gyswllt.",
    faqQ3: "Oes rhaid i mi dalu tollau/trethi mewnforio?",
    faqA3: "Nid yw tollau a dyletswyddau yn cael eu talu ymlaen llaw fel arfer, ac eithrio DDP i'r UD. Gall TAW fod yn berthnasol i'r UE, DU, AU/NZ, Norwy, Y Swistir, a thaleithiau Canada fel Saskatchewan a Manitoba, sy'n cael ei dalu eisoes yn ddiofyn. Nid oes TAW yn berthnasol i Singapore. Ni allwn gynghori ar ffioedd tollau—cysylltwch â'ch tollau lleol am fanylion.",
    faqQ4: "Pryd mae fy archeb yn cael ei hanfon?",
    faqA4: "Fel arfer caiff archebion eu hanfon o fewn 1-5 diwrnod gwaith. Yn ystod cyfnodau o nifer uchel, gall gymryd 5-7 diwrnod.",
    faqQ5: "Fe wnes i archebu ddwywaith drwy ddamwain. Beth ddylwn i ei wneud?",
    faqA5: "Rydym yn ad-dalu ffioedd cludo dyblyg yn unig. Bydd y ddwy eitem yn cael eu cludo gyda'i gilydd. Ad-daliad = (ffioedd cludo cyntaf + ail) – ffi cludo gwirioneddol.",
